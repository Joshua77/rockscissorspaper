# ROCK SCISSORS PAPER GAME

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules. 

A brief summary:

If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper

In this version, one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player). 
I used Python Random Module.
